```c++
using namespace llvm;
```
Name space is a feature added to C++ and not present in C and is used to to identify which function to call in case multiple functions of the same name are present in the header file. Declaring this statement at the start of the code ensures that the programmer does't have to write **llvm::** before every function that uses this scope.

* Line 51
```c++
static Function *CreateFibFunction(Module *M, LLVMContext &Context)
```
Declaring a function before main, one of the ways a function can be declared. The return type is static Function* , Function being an user defined data type. 

* Line 68
```c++
ArgX->setName("AnArg");  
```
ArgX is a pointer variable to a class object and **->** is being used to access public function of the class

* Line 76
```c++
Value *CondInst = new ICmpInst(*BB, ICmpInst::ICMP_SLE, ArgX, Two, "cond");
```
new is a basic c++ feature that is used to allocate memory. While calling new parameter may be passed according to the constructor one may like to call to allocate space to as well as initialize the parameters contained in the class object.

* Line 99
```c++
return FibF;
```
return is used here to give back the value indicated after return. Return is also used to return control from the function back to the point where it was called (usually main). In case of a void function the end bracket serves the purpose but it may be coded somwhere in between in order to return control if certain condition is satisfied
