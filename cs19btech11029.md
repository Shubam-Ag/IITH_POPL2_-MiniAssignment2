# Mini Assignment 2: Large Code Bases and OOP
## Fibonacci 
*https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/llvm/examples/Fibonacci*
#### **Description:** 
This small program provides an example of how to build quickly a small module with function Fibonacci and execute it with the JIT.The goal of this snippet is to create in the memory the LLVM module.
#### Design:
The code is has simple design. It imports functions from the included header file. The header files contain various user defined data types and functions that are grouped in a virtual class. A function is written using data types in all these function. Only functions are used to manipulate the value of user defined data types and many times a single function calls and refers to multiple static class functions
#### **User Defined Data Types Used:**
Function , FunctionType , BasicBlock , Value , Argument , CallInst , LLVMContext , GenericValue

#### **Basic C++ Data Types Used:**
std::unique_ptr , std::string ,   std::vector
* Line 49:
```c++
using namespace llvm;
```
Name space is a feature added to C++ and not present in C and is used to to identify which function to call in case multiple functions of the same name are present in the header file. Declaring this statement at the start of the code ensures that the programmer does't have to write **llvm::** before every function that uses this scope.

* Line 51
```c++
static Function *CreateFibFunction(Module *M, LLVMContext &Context)
```
Declaring a function before main, one of the ways a function can be declared. The return type is static Function* , Function being an user defined data type. 

* Line 68
```c++
ArgX->setName("AnArg");  
```
ArgX is a pointer variable to a class object and **->** is being used to access public function of the class. These functions can be accessed by creating a instance of the class that points to the same memory location using pointer and then call the function on that instance using the **.** operator.

* Line 76
```c++
Value *CondInst = new ICmpInst(*BB, ICmpInst::ICMP_SLE, ArgX, Two, "cond");
```
new is a basic c++ feature that is used to allocate memory. While calling new parameter may be passed according to the constructor one may like to call to allocate space to as well as initialize the parameters contained in the class object.

* Line 99
```c++
return FibF;
```
return is used here to give back the value indicated after return. Return is also used to return control from the function back to the point where it was called (usually main). In case of a void function the end bracket serves the purpose but it may be coded somwhere in between in order to return control if certain condition is satisfied

* Line 102
```c++
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
```
argc and argv are arguments passed with main and used to directly take paramters when giving command to run the executable instead of prompting user for an input after the code starts running. 

* Line 110
```c++
std::unique_ptr<Module> Owner(new Module("test", Context));
```
std::unique_ptr is a data type that was introduced in C++11 and is used to create a pointer whose value cannot be copied. This helps the program to better claim the resources back as when this pointer is destroyed so is the object associated with it.

* Line 135-137
```c++
  errs() << "OK\n";
  errs() << "We just constructed this LLVM module:\n\n---------\n" << *M;
  errs() << "---------\nstarting fibonacci(" << n << ") with JIT...\n";
 ```
 errs is a user defined function and it is taking input using the **<<** operator using a overloaded **<<** operator which returns reference back to the *ostream* object
* Line 140
```c++
std::vector<GenericValue> Args(1);
```
Declaring a vector of type GenericValue

## ExceptionDemo
*https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/llvm/examples/ExceptionDemo/ExceptionDemo.cpp*

#### Description: 
Demo program which implements an example LLVM exception implementation, and shows several test cases including the handling of foreign exceptions. It is run with type info types arguments to throw. A test will be run for each given type info type.

#### Design
Value 2 causes an exception with a type info type of 2 to be thrown and caught by an inner generated test function.
Value 3 causes an exception with a type info type of 3 to be thrown and caught by an outer generated test function.
Value 7 causes an exception with a type info type of 7 to be thrown and NOT be caught by any generated function.
Value -1 causes a foreign C++ exception to be thrown and not be caught by any generated function
Cases -1 and 7 are caught by a C++ test harness where the validity of a C++ catch(...) clause catching a generated exception with a type info type
#### **User Defined Data Types Used:**
*OurBaseException_t , _Unwind_Exception , llvm::StructType , llvm::ConstantInt , llvm::Function , llvm::Type , etc*
#### **Basic C++ Data Types Used:**
std::map , int64_t , static uint64_t
* Line 83-85
```c++
#ifndef USE_GLOBAL_STR_CONSTS
#define USE_GLOBAL_STR_CONSTS true
#endif
```
ifndef define and endif are macros and are used to make sure what sections of the code are to be executed , these are used to prevent any code breaking error that may occur due to same line of code executing twice.
* Line 113-114
```c++
typedef struct OurBaseException_t OurException;
typedef struct _Unwind_Exception OurUnwindException;
```
typedef is used to change how a certain user defined structure will be refered to in code. Instead of specifying struct class_name one can refer using class_name* only. This is a type of abstraction. 
* Line 125-126
```c++
const unsigned char ourBaseExcpClassChars[] =
{'o', 'b', 'j', '\0', 'b', 'a', 's', '\0'};
```
const is used to decalare immutable variable , these cannot be modified by user during run time and are usually used to store refernces to some maximum or minimum value that can be achieved by a variable or function. 
* Line 143-144
```c++
typedef std::vector<std::string> ArgNames;
typedef std::vector<llvm::Type*> ArgTypes;
```
typedef is used to change how a certain user defined structure will be refered to in code. Instead of specifying struct class_name one can refer using class_name* only. This is a type of abstraction. It can also be used to modify the names of other type od data elemets that may or may not be user defined. 

* Line 221-229
```c++
namespace {
template <typename Type_>
uintptr_t ReadType(const uint8_t *&p) {
  Type_ value;
  memcpy(&value, p, sizeof(Type_));
  p += sizeof(Type_);
  return static_cast<uintptr_t>(value);
}
}
```
A namespace is a declarative region that provides a scope to the identifiers (names of the types, function, variables etc) inside it.Multiple namespace blocks with the same name are allowed. All declarations within those blocks are declared in the named scope.

* Line 225
```c++
memcpy(&value, p, sizeof(Type_));
```
Copies the values of num bytes from the location pointed to by source directly to the memory block pointed to by destination.The underlying type of the objects pointed to by both the source and destination pointers are irrelevant for this function; The result is a binary copy of the data.
